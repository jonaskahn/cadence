## What is Cadence?

Cadence is a multi-agent orchestration framework built with modern Python technologies like LangChain and LangGraph. It
provides a robust foundation for creating intelligent, collaborative AI systems, and a clean plugin system that keeps
your core code decoupled from custom functionality.

## Quick Installation

**For end users:**

```bash
pip install cadence-py
python -m cadence start api
```

**For developers:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonaskahn/cadence.git
cd cadence
poetry install
poetry run python -m cadence start api
```

## Philosophy

Cadence is built on three core principles:

### 1. Simplicity First

- Clean, intuitive APIs that get out of your way
- Minimal boilerplate code for maximum productivity
- Clear separation of concerns between core system and plugins

### 2. Plugin-Driven Architecture

- Everything is a plugin â€” from agents to tools
- Hot-reloadable plugins for rapid development
- True decoupling between core system and custom functionality

### 3. Production Ready

- Built for scale with enterprise-grade reliability
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Docker support and cloud-native deployment

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinate multiple AI agents in complex workflows with intelligent routing
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality without touching core code with dynamic plugin discovery
- **Hot Reloading**: Update plugins without restarting the system with automatic graph rebuilding
- **LLM Agnostic**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more with separate model configurations for coordinator,
  suspend, and finalizer
- **REST API**: Full HTTP API for integration with any system
- **Operational API**: Endpoints for chat, plugins, status, and health
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in observability and debugging tools with detailed execution tracking
- **Tone Control**: Dynamic response style adaptation for personalized interactions (natural, formal, concise,
  explanatory, learning)
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Hop limits, message filtering, and error handling to prevent infinite loops
- **State Management**: Robust conversation state tracking with standardized updates

## Quick Example

```python
from cadence_sdk import BasePlugin, PluginMetadata, BaseAgent


class MyPlugin(BasePlugin):
    @staticmethod
    def get_metadata() -> PluginMetadata:
        return PluginMetadata(
            name="my_agent",
            version="0.1.0",
            description="My custom AI agent",
            capabilities=["custom_task"],
        )

    @staticmethod
    def create_agent() -> BaseAgent:
        return MyAgent(MyPlugin.get_metadata())


class MyAgent(BaseAgent):
    def get_tools(self):
        return [my_custom_tool]

    def get_system_prompt(self):
        return "You are a helpful AI assistant."
```
